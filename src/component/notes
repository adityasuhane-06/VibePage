   {/* here we write the renderBlock function under main compenent is based on the react and javascript principle 

    1.Encapsulation: The function is defined within the component, allowing it to access props and state directly.

    2. Organization of code:Keeps all the complex rendering logic separate from the main component structure

    3. Access to component Scope : the inner function has access to the component's props and state, allowing it to use them directly without needing to pass them as arguments.

    4. Direct JSX in return (messy)
    5.External function (loses scope access)
    6. Good for:

Complex conditional rendering
Multiple rendering paths
When you need access to component scope
Keeping main return statement clean
